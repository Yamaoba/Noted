## About The Project

![Noted. Screeenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yamaoba/Noted/refs/heads/main/image/Demo.png)

Noted is a free and open-source note-taking app built with Python and QT. I created it as my first project to challenge myself and build something similar to Notepad.

I'm still a beginner when it comes to Programming (That's why i use Python), and this is my first time making a GUI app like this, so I apologize if there are any bugs or imperfections. I’m constantly learning and improving, so your feedback is really appreciated.

The goal of Noted is to make note-taking simple and organized, without the need for any complicated features. It’s perfect for jotting down ideas, creating to-do lists, or keeping track of important information. I wanted to create something that’s easy to use for everyone (even a baby can use this too!).

Thanks for checking out my "Noted" app. It’s a work in progress, and I hope you find it useful! Feel free to share your thoughts or suggestions as I continue to improve the app.

- The Python and QT documentation, which helped me understand the basics of building a GUI app.
- Any tutorials or guides I found online; I wouldn’t have been able to do it without them!
